# about
Exercises for programming, usually taken from various sources. If sample solutions are available they will be included.
Some parts will be german since some sources are german.

The exercises will be sorted by difficulty. I'm currently using 10 difficulty levels. The meanings are taken from [here](https://wiki.freitagsrunde.org/Javakurs/%C3%9Cbungsaufgaben#Schwierigkeitsgrade):

* **1**: Tutorial only, not much thinking needed.
* **3**: Easy exercise. Insecure students are guided well.
* **5**: Typical exercise at the university, some hints are given. 
* **7**: Challenging, aimed for fit students.
* **9**: Experienced programmers should be occupied for one to two hours.
* **10**: Difficult, it may be hard to solve.
